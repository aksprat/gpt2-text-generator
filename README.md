# gpt2-text-generator
A demo of a GPT-2 text generation app deployed on DigitalOcean.

Building a text generation web app based on GPT-2 or GPT-Neo, where attendees can interact with the model in real-time.

Hereâ€™s a detailed plan for setting up a Generative AI demo:

# Deploying a GPT-2 Text Generation Web App on DigitalOcean

**Objective:**
Show how to use an open-source generative AI model like GPT-2 for text generation.

Deploy the model on a server (droplet) or an App Platform on DigitalOcean.

Create a simple web interface where users can input a prompt, and the model will generate text based on it.

**Tech Stack:**
**Model**: GPT-2 (from Hugging Face Transformers)

**Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI) to serve the model API

**Frontend**: Simple HTML/JS or React for a dynamic interface

**Deployment**: DigitalOcean Droplet or DigitalOcean App Platform

**Docker**: For containerizing the application

**Nginx**: Optionally as a reverse proxy for production
